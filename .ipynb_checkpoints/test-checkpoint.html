This text is a preface to a book about the author's interest in space flight. The author describes their interest in the topic, which began when they were given a book about the feasibility of space flight as a child. They go on to describe their professional background in physics, and how this led to their interest in fusion research. Finally, they describe how they came to work with Ted Taylor and Freeman Dyson on the Orion nuclear bomb propulsion concept.</p>

Deuterium is the most abundant element in the universe, and it is also the fuel of  choice for the thermonuclear reactions used in this study.  It is available on Earth, but also on all the larger moons of the solar system, and in the form of  cometary ices, in the Oort cloud.  The reaction products of deuterium with deuterium or with tritium are  He3 and He4, also available in the outer solar system, but in much smaller quantities.  Argon is a suitable propellant, because it is abundant in the solar system,  and it can be easily ionized.  The energy needed to ionize argon is much smaller than the energy  available in the thermonuclear reactions.  Super explosives with energy densities in the keV/cm3 range are  required to trigger the thermonuclear reactions.  These are available on Earth, but also on all the larger moons of the solar system, and in the form of cometary ices, in the Oort cloud.

The text discusses the feasibility of using deuterium thermonuclear reactions to power a spacecraft capable of reaching the outer limits of the solar system and beyond. It argues that such a spacecraft would be able to explore the solar system and potentially other solar systems, and that the cost of research and development would be high but justified.</p>

Magnetic insulation permits the attainment of very high voltages in vacuum, while inductive charging allows for a conductor to be charged to very high potentials. Together, these two concepts could be used to power a deuterium fusion-driven starship.</p>

The text discusses the need for a high-powered propulsion system for manned spaceflight, and argues that the only known concept with this property is the nuclear bomb propulsion concept. However, the author notes that small nuclear explosions are undesirable, and that the propulsion by non-fission-triggered fusion bombs is a better option. The text also discusses the advantages of using a pure deuterium bomb for propulsion, as opposed to a DT bomb.</p>
